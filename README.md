# üîê Task 4 ‚Äì Firewall Setup and Configuration

## üéØ Objective
To configure and test basic firewall rules on a Linux system using UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall). The goal was to block and allow specific ports (e.g., Telnet on port 23, SSH on port 22), test them, and understand how firewall rules affect network traffic.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & System Used
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 22.04 (Linux)
- **Firewall Tool:** UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
- **Terminal**
- **Telnet & SSH (for testing)**
- **Netcat (optional for local testing)**

## ‚úÖ What I Did During This Task

1. **Checked UFW Status**
   - Verified whether UFW was active and checked default policies.

2. **Enabled UFW**
   - If disabled, I enabled UFW to start configuring it.

3. **Listed Existing Rules**
   - Viewed current active firewall rules using `sudo ufw status`.

4. **Blocked Port 23 (Telnet)**
   - Added a rule to deny inbound traffic on TCP port 23 using:
     ```bash
     sudo ufw deny 23
     ```

5. **Tested Telnet Block**
   - Attempted to connect to localhost on port 23 using:
     ```bash
     telnet localhost 23
     ```
   - Received a ‚ÄúConnection refused‚Äù error ‚Äî this showed no Telnet service was running.

6. **Simulated Port 23 (Telnet) Using Netcat**
   - Used `nc -l -p 23` to simulate a listener.
   - Connected successfully with `telnet localhost 23` when UFW allowed port 23.
   - Verified the port was blocked when UFW denied it.

7. **Allowed Port 22 (SSH)**
   - Ensured SSH was accessible using:
     ```bash
     sudo ufw allow 22
     ```

8. **Verified Rule Application**
   - Used `sudo ufw status verbose` to confirm changes.
   - SSH connection tested using:
     ```bash
     ssh <username>@localhost
     ```

9. **Removed Telnet Block Rule**
   - Cleaned up the test rule using:
     ```bash
     sudo ufw delete deny 23
     ```

10. **Took Screenshots**
    - Captured each major step: enabling UFW, blocking and allowing ports, testing with Telnet and SSH, removing rules.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This project is intended strictly for educational purposes as part of a cybersecurity internship task. The configurations, commands, and testing methods used (e.g., Telnet on port 23) are demonstrated in a controlled, local environment.

Do not expose insecure services like Telnet on real or public-facing systems, as they are highly vulnerable to attacks. Always follow best practices for system and network security in production environments.
